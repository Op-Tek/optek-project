# optek-project
An open-source, C++ based Artificial intelligence framework for games.

Op-Tek is a C++ framework for game development, providing various levels of Complexity for AIs in NPCs.
We aim to make AIs easier to develop while making them feel more natural in games using multiple factors.
Developers will also find it easy to integrate Op-Tek into their game - every class is made as simple as possible, and all integration needs (move, etc.) are included in a single file.

Currently, the project is still in development, but will be ready for use soon!

A terms-and-conditions file is included, and the overview of it is as so:



## FAQ
Q: What is the purpose of Op-Tek? 
A: To simplify and advance NPC development for games.

Q: How do I integrate Op-Tek?
A: In the file "todo-integrate.h," you will find multiple functions required by Op-Tek. Just add your engine's versions of them into the function and make sure it works.

Q: Why are the NPCs considered "realistic?"
A: Op-Tek AIs function with multiple variables: most notably, they interact with your game's mechanics and check for changes- things we noticed help them feel more realistic. This includes using 'barks' as often as possible, noticing if you opened a door, using various health items when needed and listening for noises. There are also options for changing the way AI groups are equipped - if the player tends to use a certain tactic, AIs will change accordingly.
